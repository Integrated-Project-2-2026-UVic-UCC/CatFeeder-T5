## 📌 Project Overview

Pet ownership has significantly increased in recent years, while modern lifestyles often limit the time available for daily pet care. Feeding is one of the most critical and repetitive tasks in pet ownership, requiring consistency, portion control, and reliability to ensure animal health.

This project aims to design and implement a **reliable, autonomous automatic cat feeder** capable of dispensing controlled food portions at predefined times using embedded systems and automation principles.

Unlike many commercial solutions, this system focuses on:

- Accurate portion control  
- Mechanical reliability  
- Safe motor operation  
- Embedded system coordination  
- Future scalability and modularity

## 🎯 Objectives

### Main Objective

Design and implement an automatic cat feeder capable of dispensing controlled portions of food at predefined times in a reliable, safe, and autonomous manner.

### Specific Objectives

- Dispense food at programmed times without user intervention  
- Deliver consistent and accurate food portions  
- Minimize risk of mechanical blockage  
- Coordinate sensors, actuators, and timing logic efficiently  
- Prevent motor overrun and unintended dispensing  
- Optimize power consumption  
- Validate performance under real operating conditions  
- Enable future scalability (additional sensors, connectivity, etc.)

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system is divided into four main subsystems:

### ⚙️ Mechanical System
- Hopper and dispensing mechanism  
- Anti-blockage design  
- 3D-printed structural components  

### ⚡ Electronics System
- Microcontroller-based control unit  
- Motor driver  
- Load cell + ADC (HX711)  
- Power supply and protection systems  

### 🧠 Embedded Software
- State-machine-based firmware  
- Scheduled feeding logic  
- Weight-based dispensing control  
- Safety and fault handling mechanisms  

### 🧪 Validation
- Functional testing  
- Accuracy testing  
- Reliability and endurance testing
